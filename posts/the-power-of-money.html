            <p>​Money has been in this world for a few thousand years now, with its invention linking to the exchange of goods. But in today's age, it is often associated with power. There's no denying that having money opens many possibilities that would otherwise not exist for a man. But are we mindfully using those opportunities? Are those opportunities needed in the first place? Let's explore! Money plays a huge role in creating a sense of security in today's society - A role once played by physical dominance and/or, human intelligence​. These factors dictated our survival at some point. But does it really guarantee security? Nothing does. Life is fragile and unpredictable. Money was supposed to add convenience, to make it easier to exchange goods and services for survival. But somewhere along the way, we lost the plot. We slipped down a slope with no clear end, to the point where some of us have made it the entire purpose of our lives. We grew up in this world, saw everyone running on a hamster wheel, stepped on it without questioning, and have been doing it ever since. Some are approaching the ends of their lives, still running on that wheel because, well, nobody taught them to step off. Money has become like a moving target that we never manage to reach, because never did we question the definition of 'enough'.</p>
<p>The tricky part is that "enough" isn’t a fixed number. It depends on what we personally need, sure, but it’s also shaped by the world around us. What happens when everyone around you stays in the game longer and accumulates more? They drive up the cost of living, push the price of healthcare, inflate the definition of success. Suddenly, what felt like enough five years ago isn’t enough anymore.</p>
<p>That’s why setting strict financial limits doesn’t always work. Inflation can change things, and unexpected life events can happen. But instead of obsessing over an arbitrary number, maybe it’s about clarity - knowing what you truly need to live a happy and healthy life and evaluating that from time to time. It takes deep reflection, and openness to learn as well as unlearn. Without that, it’s easy to keep running just because the world makes it seem like you should.</p>
<p>The goal isn't to reject money, but to understand its place. You can't opt out of the system if you want to live in this society. But you can't be completely out of sync with yourself either. The balance is knowing where to draw the line.</p>
<p>One way to go about it is to formulate your definition of your own 'good enough', by multiplying your basic yearly expenses with your estimated years on this planet, based on the average life expectancy of a healthy human (*factoring in inflation). Beyond that, the extra might be useful, but in what meaningful ways does it add to your life, if any? That's for you to find out. ​Money was supposed to be a tool, not the goal. Through an examined life, lived with mindfulness and continuous reflection, one can differentiate between the two. I'm on that journey, and constantly trying to figure out the right balance. I will keep sharing as I learn.</p>
