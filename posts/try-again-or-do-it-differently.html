            <p>Have there been times in your life when you asked yourself this question? Often, setbacks in our journeys test our determination and capacity to persist. But sometimes, the setbacks signal a need to change course. For a different course might lead to the same outcome, or a better one.</p>
<p>​"Can I do it differently this time?" - That’s the question I ask myself as I find myself heading toward injury-again. Injuries are no strangers in my life. Over the last 10 years of ~~training~~ workouts (the way I was doing it wasn't really training), I've spent more time recovering from injuries than actually training. Each time, I was lucky enough to come back, and as I write this, I'm still in the process of recovering from one, muscular imbalances bad enough to bring me down from easily running 21K to struggling to cover 2 kilometers without pain.</p>
<p>My tendency to push too hard too soon is to blame, most of the times. At least, I believe so. Is it because the runner’s high is too strong and gets me carried away? Or is it that the will to sacrifice today’s high for a longer tomorrow isn’t strong enough? A tomorrow where I'm able to stay injury free for years - something that hasn't happened in the last decade. My defaults won't help me get there, so I have to consciously override them. This doesn't guarantee a different outcome but opens up the possibility for one, which is 'good enough'. ​While the example of running may not apply to all, if you dig deeply enough, you might find patterns in your lives that are keeping you 'stuck', for lack of a better word. Often, our biggest strengths become the obstacles when overused, because as they say it - <em>when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail</em>.</p>
<p>We pick up different tools, master them, and they usually work well for us. Seldom do we question if the same tools could be also causing some of our problems. A common example is attachment styles that we develop as children. Patterns which, helpful back then, often become the biggest roadblocks in our relationships. I have several examples from my own life. My hedonic approach to training - giving it my best in the moment, yielded some great results. But that same approach also led to repeated injuries. I'm fortunate enough to be able to try a different approach. But I'll find out only in a few months how well I'm practicing what I preach here.</p>
<p>One thing I can say with certainty is that ​I'm learning my lessons the hard way. Are you? Or are you still in the process of identifying the lessons you need to learn?</p>
