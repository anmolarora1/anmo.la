            <h3><strong><em>Some Background</em></strong></h3>
<p>A more appropriate title could be: "What Journaling Continues to Teach Me". ​For me, journaling started out as a way of self-help when I was dealing with the challenges of a broken relationship. Back then, I was mostly writing to rationalise my thoughts and put things onto paper to reinforce ideas. I got through those challenges and luckily, the habit of writing continued. It's been almost two years now since I started journaling regularly.<br>
While not religious about it, I've been writing over 80% of this time. It's the first thing in the morning, after I start my day. My friends and some people at coffee shops who've noticed me journaling have often asked: "What do you write about?" There's no fixed pattern. I write about anything and everything - from understanding my feelings to exploring concepts about the world, and sometimes, organising my plans for the future. I can't even recall what else I write about. One thing I try to maintain is noting down the things I'm grateful for each day. Acknowledging small reasons to be grateful for works wonders. Outside that, it's pretty flexible.</p>
<h3><strong><em>Why do I journal?</em></strong></h3>
<p>For me, journaling is usually not goal-oriented in the traditional sense. ​I write because it helps me clear my head, interrupting the default patterns and the feelings and actions that run on an auto-pilot mode. It's that simple - simple, yet effective. At times, it's a rescue tool to calm down my anxiety, which could vary in intensity based on the situation. Mostly, it's just about getting into the rhythm of the day, feeling clear-headed, which, in turn, impacts the rest of my day.<br>
The impact of journaling on my life - my mental peace and clarity - is profound. It continues to teach me to think clearly, which in turn, helps me in other areas of life - professional and personal. ​</p>
<h3><strong><em>Why should you try it?</em></strong></h3>
<p>​Journaling has been vouched for by many successful people - entrepreneurs, actors, writers, you name it. Steven Pressfield has described it as a way to find your "muse." Julia Cameron has talked about the Morning Pages (journal) in her famous book <em>The Artist's Way</em>. Matthew McConaughey has been journaling since his early teens. The examples can go on and on.<br>
If you seek clarity in an overstimulating world and want to connect with your inner self, give it a shot. Like any other habit, it will be challenging at first. Often, you might face the tricky question: "What do I write about?" I struggle with that question many times. There are moments when I just sit there, holding a pen, staring at my open notebook, wondering what to write. But five minutes down, I'm writing. Once the pen hits the paper, you start getting into the flow. And sometimes, you don't, which is okay.<br>
It's just like training your muscles. Not all training sessions will go great. But by showing up, you ensure you don't miss out on the ones which do. The magic continues to happen through consistency. The same concepts apply to journaling - every time you write, you strengthen that mental muscle. Sooner or later, you will find yourself getting stronger. At the end of the day, it's a simple habit with the potential to transform your life.<br>
So why not give it a try? :)</p>
