            <h4><strong><em>Soul food</em></strong></h4>
<p>Unlike the food we eat that nourishes our bodies, the desires we chase—money, pleasure, fame, or even love (love in it's conventional form) which offer some sort of gratification, soul food doesn't necessarily produce a result. Or at least, it doesn't chase one. It's the creative act, the hunger for learning, the deeply embedded passion for something—the pursuit of which brings the feeling of contentment. It's not something that can be achieved or attained—it has to be pursued every day. It’s the painter's commitment to creating a beautiful painting, the musician’s devotion to producing a symphony that stirs hearts, the athlete’s relentless training to defy odds and chase the impossible (like breaking the four-minute mile), the poet’s practice of distilling beauty into words, and the professional's lifelong pursuit of mastering their craft.</p>
<h4><strong><em>Why it's needed?</em></strong></h4>
<p>We move through life focused on levers that seem important—food, money, pleasure, being loved in one form or another. For the most part, these are necessary to survive, so we tend to automate them. We rarely question why we need food or money; they’re simply our 'necessities.' ​But if we are faced with a big question—what if we slept tonight and didn't wake up tomorrow? More importantly, what if we are told that we've only got a few days to live? Would eating our way to glory, or spending millions (if we saved at all) help us feel truly content as we exit the world? Would the pleasure of alcohol, drugs, or sex be enough to satisfy the deeper desire—the one that longs to play our role in this world? Would we be willing to leave without the regrets of missing out on anything? If the answer is yes, it's great for you. You are safe from the dis-ease of not fulfilling the purpose of your lives. On the other hand, if you’re one of those few people already on the journey of living a purposeful live—those who sleep peacefully knowing they’ve done their part for the day—more power to you. But if you find yourself in the middle, knowing what you are doing is not enough to feed your souls, and struggling to find what will—Congratulations! You are not alone. I’m on the same quest, and I’m grateful that the dis-ease exists within me. As much as I want to take care of my needs and necessities, I can feel the uneasiness of not nourishing the soul. However, I don't want the 'act of doing' to be substituted by the mental masturbation of 'knowing'. It's easy to fall down that trap, and I've done that for quite some time. ​I’m still figuring out what the doing looks like for me. Maybe it’s this constant pursuit of trying, failing, learning—and sharing these chapters from my life as a way to feed my soul. Or maybe it's something much more. We will find out. I'd be happy to die trying than not doing anything at all.</p>
