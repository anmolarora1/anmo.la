        <div class="content" id="content">
            <p>Many people preach the narrative of 'mind over body' in the realm of training hard—and often for good reason. They might have experienced it, or heard about it, and it gets passed on so often that it becomes second nature. I am no different. I have been telling myself the same narrative to get through tough workouts and push through them. No wonder it is helpful, because a part of us is always seeking the easy way, reasons to quit, and not push through pain. I was reflecting upon that narrative in my journal today, and questioning myself—What if it's not true? What if the mind and the body are designed to work in harmony—as a single unit?</p>
<p>Over the last couple of years, I have experienced a fair share of injuries—more than I can even count. So much so that the pattern became clear to my friends and even the people who sparingly knew about me—he will train, overtrain, and get injured. And they were not wrong. Looking back, I was always pushing myself too hard, and not listening to my body. Basically, overusing the tool I trusted the most—don't listen to your body because it wants you to give up. I believe many athletes might find it relatable, especially those who've found themselves falling into the loop of chronic injuries. Reason? Just like me, they tend to overuse their strongest weapon—the samurai sword, not realising that it can cut both ways if not used with care.</p>
<p>I recently recovered from one such injury which was preventing me from running. And after a long while, I experienced the flow state—a state where my legs were moving effortlessly after 12k or so. But what followed was even more beautiful—my body was brimming with love and joy—not for anything or anyone in particular, but for everything and everyone. During the run, I was pushing myself a bit, but not too much. I could fully experience both the lows and the highs. There was no music, no distractions, just me with my body—moving through the space around me. If you are into running and are used to running with your earphones plugged in, or with people, maybe you can try running solo without any distractions sometime. It could be a meditative experience. Reflecting back, I would love to have more such experiences. Because the state of deep connection of mind and body is a beautiful one—hard to describe in mere words. It's a state where mind and body are deeply connected, the mind is listening to every little signal the body is giving it and the body does the same for the mind. Perhaps that's how great athletes operate—so in tune with their craft that the rest of the world disappears.</p>
<p>Injuries have taught me about humility and the fragility of the human body. The same body, however, when it operates in harmony with the mind has an immense potential to overcome the challenges which are beyond our imagination. Humans have demonstrated it throughout history, be it through sport or other life challenges. As I explore running, I am learning not just about staying injury free, but also the lessons of life that sport can teach me. I hope to keep sharing my journey as I learn to move my mind and body in tune, just like a Symphony.</p>
